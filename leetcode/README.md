## Usage
- Edit solution.h accoding to guidelines
- Edit main.cpp accoding to guide
- If you don't have python installed then install it first
- Run `py test.py` or `python3 test.py` or whatever you have installed to execute python files.

## Note
- Writing the `solution.h` as the one in this folder is a bad practice and is highly discouraged. The header files should only contain **declaration** and not **definition** but I've provided the method definitions for the ease of copying and pasting in leetcode IDE.
- `using namespace std` and `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is like shooting yourself in the foot for a real world project.
